Algorithm for Mean Function 
Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Create two classes â€” say ClassA and ClassB
Step 3: In each class, declare one private data member (e.g., int a;, int b;)
Step 4: Use a friend function named findMean() that can access both private members
Step 5: In each class, create a function setData() to get user input
Step 6: Define the friend function findMean() to calculate and display the mean value
Step 7: In the main() function, create objects of both classes
Step 8: Call the setData() functions for both objects
Step 9: Call the findMean() function
Step 10: Display the result
Step 11: End the program
